Beat Machine

The Beat Machine is a rhythm creation tool that allows you to compose beats using up to four sound slots. Each slot can be customized with different sounds and controlled through various buttons and sliders. The application also includes features for saving and loading beats.

Features

- Four Sound Slots: Each slot can hold a different sound and has 16 buttons (4 bars with 4 beats each) to compose the rhythm.
- Volume Control: Each slot has an individual volume control, as well as a master volume control for the entire beat.

  Playback Controls: Play, pause, and stop buttons to control the playback of your beat.
  Saving and Loading: Save your beats to a file (.bmsf format) and load them later. Four test beats are included.
